### How do the safe rooms work?

Phynti's [safe rooms] consist of both a technical infrastructure and a collaboration between multiple partners. Key contributing partners are:

* **[NGO key holders][]** (e.g. Amnesty, the International Red Cross and Doctors without Borders) who controls the key fragments that are necessary to perform decryption and thus threat monitoring. The NGOs act as a gatekeeper protecting the citizens' privacy rights.
* **[Service providers][]** (e.g. Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple) who host the data on which threat monitoring is performed. The service providers make sure that the threat monitoring happens in a neutral environment outside the direct control of law enforcement agencies. 
* Select **[law enforcement agencies][]** (e.g. Interpol), who supplies the [dictionaries][] that are used for threat monitoring, and who evaluates if results should lead to formal investigation.
