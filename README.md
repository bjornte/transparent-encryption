This repository is an illustration hopefully fuelling a discussion on how to create controlled insight (monitoring or screening) into encrypted communication without depriving indivuiduals of their privacy.

* The repository is considered merged with [Phynti][] by [Torgeir Hovden][]. 
* Proposed new user experience (UX) specification of Phynti below. 
* An older description for this repository is [here](README-old.md).
