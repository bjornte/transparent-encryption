# Transparent encryption
A discussion on how to create controlled insight (screening) into encrypted communication

*Make it harder to commit crimes<sup>1</sup> by allowing residents to voluntarily aid law enforcement by making their digital assets available in a controlled screening scenario.*

As of 2016, Tim Cook and Barack Obama is in a divisive fight over encryption, privacy rights and law enforcement’s need of screening our communication for unlawful content. Both Cook and Obama have [MLK][MLK] as an idol, so I’m assuming both want good to prevail. This repository is intended as a discussion (at least initially) for how to bridge the current gap between the parties.

Intended benefits
---
* Make it harder for criminals to communicate without detection<sup>1</sup>.
* Full encryption with no back doors.
* Screening opportunity for law enforcement in a controlled setting.
 
<sup>1</sup> Possibly this could also make it harder for AIs to communicate undetectedly.

First draft

* Multiple organizations, both governmental, commercial and [NGOs][NGO], make themselves available for upload of **partial passwords** and **partial content repositories**.
* The customer chooses which organizations to upload her partial passwords to. E.g., an Canadian customer may choose to share partials with [Amnesty][Amnesty], [UBS][UBS] and the Canadian government.
* These partial passwords can be combined into **complete passwords** and **complete content repositories** in a controlled setting.
* This controlled setting, which assumedly must adhere to strict formal requirements, has the purpose of detecting criminal behavior.
* Hopefully, this will make it as difficult as today for criminals to gain access to peoples digital assets, while making it easier for law enforcement to detect criminal activities. If this principle was widely adopted, it should be more difficult to commit crimes for two reasons:
  * Services that demanded this type of partial password and content sharing would not be less suitable for criminal activity.
  * Services that opt out of this concept would become more visible.
* A major requisite is to avoid [single points of failure][SPOF].
