This repository hopes to contribute to illustrating how to create controlled insight (monitoring or screening) into encrypted communication without depriving indivuiduals of their privacy.

Below is a hypothetic user experience (UX) specification related to [Phynti][] by [Torgeir Hovden][]. 


---

# UX spec

For the time being, there is only written material and no wireframes.

* [Landing page][]
    * [Encryption scheme][]
* [Safe rooms][]
    * [How do the safe rooms work?][]
    * [What is a safe room dictionary?][]
    * [How are the dictionaries used?][]
    * [Safe room scenarios][]

## Background info

An older description for this repository is [here](README-old.md). A related question was asked on [security.stackexchange.com][security.stackexchange.com question], but potentially because of the political nature of the question, it was closed. Perhaps in time it can be reopened.

## To do

* Improve texts
    * Proof reading.
    * Simplify further.  
    * More detailed information on technical issues.
    * Consider Norwegian version if pitching to local, public stakeholders.
* More detailed interaction design
    * Detailed flow for setting up a basic Phynti account with messages to friends etc.
    * Illustrations.
    * More detailed wireframing incl. Call to action (CTA) buttons.
* Front end development
    * Bootstrap or other CSS framework. 
    * Possibly style guide such as Pattern Lab.

### Payoff (variations)
* Digital safekeeping powered by trusting your friends.
* Put trust in your friends, with the password manager that allows you to forget.
* The password manager that allows you to forget by trusting your friends.
* It's OK forget when you trust your friends.
* Trust your friends, not your memory. (Or us.)
* Don't trust us. Don't trust yourself. Trust your friends.
* Don't trust us, or even yourself. But trust your friends.
* Trust your friends. Not us. Not yourself.

## Bin: Old text fragments

And in addition, your valuables are safe from your fleeting memory.

We're safer because we're different: We don't store your passwords, and we don't require you to remember the master key to the vault (although remembering it is convenient).
