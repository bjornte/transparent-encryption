A discussion on how to create controlled insight (screening) into encrypted communication
As of 2016, Tim Cook and Barack Obama is in a divisive fight over encryption, privacy rights and the governements’ need of screening our communication for unlawful content. Both Cook and Obama have MLK as an idol, so I’m assuming both want good to prevail. This repository is intended as a discussion (at least initially) for how to bridge the current gap between the parties.
